## Overview

The SmartRoute backend is responsible for real-time route optimization, emissions calculation, batch delivery clustering, EV compatibility checks, analytics, and seamless integration with third-party APIs. The system is designed for high scalability, reliability, and security, supporting both web and mobile clients.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Diagram

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client and partner requests.
- **Auth Service**: OAuth2.0-based authentication and authorization.
- **Routing Engine**: Optimizes delivery routes considering emissions, fuel, weather, and time.
- **Clustering Service**: Groups deliveries using geo-spatial algorithms.
- **Emissions Calculator**: Computes real-time and historical CO₂/fuel metrics.
- **EV Compatibility Service**: Checks EV feasibility and charging infrastructure.
- **Analytics \& Dashboard Service**: Aggregates KPIs and fleet comparisons.
- **Admin/Simulation Service**: Handles scenario adjustments and reporting.
- **Integration Layer**: Connects to Google Maps, Places, OpenWeatherMap, and vehicle data APIs.
- **Data Store**: Centralized database for deliveries, vehicles, users, and analytics.
- **File Storage**: For CSV uploads and exports.


## Core Backend Services

### 1. API Gateway

- Handles RESTful and gRPC requests.
- Rate limiting, request validation, and routing to internal services.


### 2. Authentication \& Authorization

- OAuth2.0 with JWT tokens.
- Role-based access: Admin, Logistics Manager, Fleet Operator, Sustainability Officer.


### 3. Routing Engine

- Integrates with Google Maps API for real-time traffic and routing.
- Multi-objective optimization (emissions, fuel, time).
- Supports batch and single-route calculations.


### 4. Batch Delivery Clustering

- Implements DBSCAN or similar geo-spatial clustering.
- Assigns vehicles based on cluster requirements and vehicle profiles.


### 5. Emissions \& Fuel Calculator

- Uses EPA/NREL datasets for emission factors.
- Real-time and batch calculations.
- Compares optimized vs. manual/default routes.


### 6. EV Compatibility Checker

- Checks route feasibility for EVs (range, charging stations).
- Integrates with Google Places API for charger locations.
- Provides warnings for non-EV-compatible paths.


### 7. Weather-Aware Routing

- Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API.
- Reroutes deliveries to avoid adverse weather zones.


### 8. Analytics \& Dashboard

- Aggregates KPIs: CO₂ saved, fuel saved, time efficiency, distance reduced.
- Fleet comparison: emissions, EV adoption, delivery reliability.


### 9. Bulk Upload \& Export

- CSV/JSON import for bulk deliveries.
- Export of optimized plans and scenario reports.


## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| POST | /api/v1/optimize-route | Optimize delivery route | Yes |
| POST | /api/v1/cluster-deliveries | Cluster delivery points | Yes |
| POST | /api/v1/check-ev-compat | Check EV compatibility | Yes |
| GET | /api/v1/emissions | Get emissions/fuel metrics | Yes |
| GET | /api/v1/analytics/dashboard | Get sustainability KPIs | Yes |
| POST | /api/v1/bulk-upload | Upload CSV for bulk deliveries | Yes |
| GET | /api/v1/export-plan | Export optimized plan (CSV/JSON) | Yes |
| POST | /api/v1/admin/simulate | Adjust routing priorities (admin only) | Admin |
| POST | /api/v1/auth/login | User authentication | No |

### API Best Practices

- Input validation and schema enforcement (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Pagination for large result sets.
- Consistent error handling (HTTP status codes, error codes, messages).
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention.


## Data Management

### Database

- **Type:** Scalable NoSQL (Firestore) or relational (PostgreSQL) depending on workload.
- **Entities:** Users, Vehicles, Deliveries, Routes, Emissions, Clusters, Analytics, Simulation Scenarios.
- **Indexes:** Geospatial indexes for clustering and routing.


### File Storage

- **Bulk uploads:** Stored securely (Cloud Storage).
- **Exports:** Temporary signed URLs for download.


### Caching

- Frequently accessed data (e.g., emission factors, vehicle profiles) cached using Redis/Memcached.


## Integration Points

- **Google Maps API**: Routing, geolocation, traffic.
- **Google Places API**: EV charger locations.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Weather data for route planning.
- **EPA/NREL Datasets**: Emission and fuel consumption factors.
- **Mock APIs**: For warehouse/delivery system simulation.


## Security \& Compliance

- **OAuth2.0** for all API access.
- **JWT** token validation on every request.
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3).
- **Audit Logging**: All admin and sensitive operations.
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data privacy compliance.
- **Role-based access control** for all endpoints.


## Scalability \& Performance

- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless microservices, auto-scaling groups.
- **Async processing**: Background jobs for heavy computations (e.g., clustering, analytics).
- **Performance targets**: Route optimization ≤ 2 seconds for 20+ stops.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics (latency, error rates, throughput).


## Testing \& Monitoring

- **Unit \& Integration Tests**: For all services and APIs.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate 10,000+ deliveries/day.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Stackdriver, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards.
- **Alerting**: On-call rotation for critical failures.


## Deployment \& DevOps

- **Cloud Platform**: GCP (preferred), AWS or Firebase as alternatives.
- **Containerization**: Docker for all services.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (GKE/EKS).
- **Secrets Management**: Google Secret Manager/AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Zero-downtime deployments**: Blue/Green or Canary releases.


## Appendix: Key Libraries \& References

- **Routing \& Geospatial:** Google Maps SDK, GeoPandas, scikit-learn (DBSCAN)
- **Auth:** OAuthlib, PyJWT
- **API:** FastAPI/Flask, gRPC
- **Data:** SQLAlchemy, Firestore SDK, Redis
- **Testing:** pytest, Locust
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Stackdriver
