## 3. Functional Requirements

### âœ… Core Functional Features

#### 3.1 Route Optimization Interface
- **Input:** Source, multiple destinations, vehicle type (Diesel, Petrol, EV)  
- **Processing:**  
  - Optimizes for minimum emissions, cost, and delivery time  
  - Considers real-time traffic and fuel consumption estimates  
- **Output:**  
  - Optimized route  
  - Map visualization (Google Maps API)  
  - ETA, fuel/emission projections

#### 3.2 Batch Delivery Clustering
- Group delivery points using geo-spatial clustering (e.g., DBSCAN)  
- Visualize clusters on map  
- Assign vehicles to each cluster based on range/type

#### 3.3 EV Compatibility Checker
- Route scan for EV feasibility:  
  - Range vs distance  
  - Charger availability (Google Places API)  
- Suggest optimal charging points  
- Warn for non-EV-compatible paths

#### 3.4 Real-Time Emissions Calculator
- Live COâ‚‚ estimation using:  
  - Vehicle type  
  - Distance  
  - Fuel type (using standard emission factors)  
- Comparison: optimized vs default/manual route

#### 3.5 Weather-Aware Routing
- Integrate with weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)  
- Avoid high-risk zones (rain, snow, storms)  
- Recommend alternate routes with better safety and efficiency

---

## ðŸ“Š Analytics & Dashboard Features

### 3.6 Sustainability Metrics Dashboard
- KPIs to display:  
  - Total COâ‚‚ saved (kg/tons)  
  - Fuel saved (liters or km improvement)  
  - Time efficiency (minutes saved)  
  - Distance reduced (per trip or fleet-wide)

### 3.7 Fleet Comparison Tool
- Compare logistics providers:  
  - Fleet emission average  
  - EV adoption rate  
  - Historical delivery reliability (% on-time delivery)

---

## ðŸ”§ Support Tools & Integration

### 3.8 CSV Upload for Bulk Deliveries
- Upload format:  
  - Address list (source, destinations, vehicle types)  
- Automatic route optimization upon upload  
- Export optimized plan in CSV or JSON

### 3.9 API Integration (Mock)
- Simulate warehouse/delivery system APIs  
- Use mock endpoints:  
  - `POST /submit-plan`  
  - `GET /delivery-status/:id`

### 3.10 Admin Panel / Simulation Mode
- Sliders/inputs to adjust routing priorities:  
  - Emissions weight  
  - Fuel cost weight  
  - Delivery time weight  
- Visualize route variation in real-time based on changes  
- Export scenario reports for presentations or decision-making
